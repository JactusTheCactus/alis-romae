# Preface
The _Alis Romae_ is a record of ten sisters of the Vlakhou family born between 806 BCE and 754 BCE in Babylon, each with the ability to transform into a bird form. 32 editions have been written over the centuries, by various authors, but the first edition was in 432 CE, with the most recent edition, the 32nd edition, published in 2012. The Vlakhou are immortal, unless killed by a Maledictus Annulus.

# Vlakhou Sisters
The sisters are immortal, though not in the traditional sense. They can all be killed by conventional means, but, if they are not killed by a Maledictus Annulus, their body will heal back to full health, with no trace of being killed, save for a scar of the killing blow. This regeneration will only occur after complete and total death.
Examples:
- Shot to the head
	- Gunshot scar on the forehead
- Decapitation
	- Scar all the way around the neck
- Four nonlethal stab wounds, then a fifth to the heart
	- One stab scar over the heart

# Maledictus Annulos
- `Singular: Maledictus Annulus`
- `Plural: Maledictus Annulos`\
The Maledictus Annulos are a set of ten rings, forged as weapons against the Vlakhou. Upon contact, a Maledictus Annulus will cause excruciating pain, then death. As of writing, the locations of seven Maledictus Annulos are known.

# The Age of Light
The sisters all loved each other, and were rarely ever seen separate, until Sorina's horrible betrayal, forever changing the family.
- Even before the [Age of Darkness](#the-age-of-darkness), Carmen never trusted Sorina.
- Isabel looked up to Sorina
- Sorina was jealous of how Livia was adored by everyone

# The Age of Darkness

## 371 CE
- Carmen tried to save Livia's life
- Carmen failed, and Sorina killed Livia in Roman Moesia, with a Maledictus Annulus
	- Sorina said, to LIvia, before killing her:
		- “We are _Gods_, Livia. We don't need to kneel to these _specks_.”
	- This, ultimately, extinguished _The Light_, bringing about the _Age of Darkness_
- Carmen was left with Livia's corpse, slowly bleeding, filled with pain, both physical and emotional, yet unable to die
- Catalina found the pair
- Ana patched Carmen's many wounds
	- After this, Carmen developed a debilitating fear of sustaining any injury of any kind, no matter how minor
- Adriana disappeared to investigate Sorina's motives

## 384 CE
- Ana assisted Isabel in killing Sorina, to avenge Livia's death, using the same Maledictus Annulus
	- Isabel's epithet changed from `The Dreamer` to `The Avenger`
	- Isabel said, to Sorina, before killing her:
		- “Humanity does not serve us. We serve the needs of humanity. In forgetting this, you have sealed your own fate. We are the few at the whims of the many. _Dii non sumus. Potentes sumus, sed immortales non sumus. Cum morimur, sine nobis vivetur humanitas.._”
- Sorina's death brought Adriana's death to a halt
	- Adriana resented Isabel for this
		- Adriana agreed that Sorina deserved to die, but not before Adriana could uncover her motives
	- Adriana believed she could've uncovered Sorina's motives, if Sorina hadn't died

## 389 CE
- Alina disappeared

## 401 CE
- Beatrice disappeared
